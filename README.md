## Message Digest

Hash functions are extremely useful and appear in almost all information security applications. A hash function is a mathematical function that converts a numerical input value into another compressed numerical value. The input to the hash function is of arbitrary length but output is always of fixed length. Hash function coverts data of arbitrary length to a fixed length. This process is often referred to as hashing the data. In general, the hash is much smaller than the input data, hence hash functions are sometimes called compression functions. Since a hash is a smaller representation of a larger data, it is also referred to as a digest. Values returned by a hash function are called message digest or simply hash values.
